# CSCI3100 Group F6 Chinese University Problem-solving System (CUPS) Complete Code

## Front end
It is developed using html5, css and js (Bootstrap, Vue). We have divided the front end implementation into 5 parts: Login, Profile, Homepage (Forum), CreatePost, and AnswerPost pages. Each parts has one ejs(html) file, one css file. There are also seperated js file for forum and answer page.
### User Interface
Thanks to our tutor, Mr SHEN, for the suggestions, we included CUHK feature in our interface design. For example, the background photo is a drawing of the CUHK science centre, and the homepage highlighted photo is of the CUHK whole screen. On the other hand, we have used fresh color as our main color, so that the design can feature out the energetic compus in CUHK.

### Login page
At the login page, the user can login with their account and password, or register with a new account using cuhk email. We also provide assistent for users who forget their password.

### Home page (Forum)
At the home page, list of forums are displayed. Users can sort the posts by clicking on the header of the table. Moreover, they can also search on the class, title or content of posts. Once they found an interested post, they can access it by clicking the content words of the post. Users can also create a post, or access to their profile, or log out from the system.

### Create Post
At the create post page, user can open a post with header, text content and image. Opening a post require author to select an amount of credit to be given to their selected answer later.

### Answer Post
At the answer post page, we display the corresponding question and existing responds. Students can answer the post by text and/or image, while the author can select the answer they think appropriate.

## Backend
It is developed in Nodejs and Express. The database has used MySQL server. 

## Android App (Incomplete)
It is developed using android studio. However, there are only two demo images on the partial completed parts (forum searching and displaying) since we are not able to finish it in tight schedule.
