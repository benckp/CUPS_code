# CSCI3100 Group F6 Chinese University Problem-solving System (CUPS) complete code

## System Structure
### Front end
It is developed using html5, css and js (Bootstrap, Vue). We have divided the front end implementation into 5 parts: Login, Profile, Homepage (Forum), CreatePost, and AnswerPost pages. Each parts has one ejs(html) file, one css file. There are also seperated js file for forum and answer page.
#### User Interface
Thanks to our tutor, Mr SHEN, for the suggestions, we included CUHK feature in our interface design. For example, the background photo is a drawing of the CUHK science centre, and the homepage highlighted photo is of the CUHK whole screen. On the other hand, we have used fresh color as our main color, so that the design can feature out the energetic compus in CUHK.

#### Login page
At the login page, the user can login with their account and password, or register with a new account using cuhk email. We also provide assistent for users who forget their password.

#### Home page (Forum)
At the home page, list of forums are displayed. Users can sort the posts by clicking on the header of the table. Moreover, they can also search 


### Backend
It is developed in Nodejs and Express.
The database has used MySQL. We will proceed to deploy our service to AWS s.t. our service will be more reliable and flexible.

### Android App
It is developed using android studio. Note that it is a new feature which we didn't put in our initial design doc. Thanks to our tutor, Mr SHEN, for the suggestion to us. Since we are all new to app development, there is only a partially implemented forum search and display page in the apps. We will try to make it cool in the next phase.  
Remark: there are two demo images on the partial completed parts (forum searching and displaying).
