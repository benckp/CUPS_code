# CSCI3100 Group F6 Chinese University Problem-solving System (CUPS) initial code

## System Structure
### Front end
It is developed using html5, css and js (Bootstrap, Vue). The executable completed part are mainly about our main functions but not styling or ui. We will proceed to incorperate the CUHK feature into our design.

### Backend
It is developed in Nodejs and Express.
The database has used MySQL. We will proceed to deploy our service to AWS s.t. our service will be more reliable and flexible.

### Android App
It is developed using android studio. Note that it is a new feature which we didn't put in our initial design doc. Thanks to our tutor, Mr SHEN, for the suggestion to us. Since we are all new to app development, there is only a partially implemented forum search and display page in the apps. We will try to make it cool in the next phase.  
Remark: there are two demo images on the partial completed parts (forum searching and displaying).
